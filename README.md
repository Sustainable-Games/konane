## About Konane
Konane is a classic Hawaiian game played with pieces of colors (typically black lava rock and white coral) on a grid that can be square or rectangular. Common board sizes are 6 x 6 for a quick game to as large as 14 x 14; or 9×13, 14×17, or 13×20 for a rectangular board. The playing pieces are alternated to cover all of the spaces on the board in a checkerboard pattern.

To begin play, players choose a color. Black always moves first.
